# Report Section Specification

This repository owns the section specification because the assignment references this
file but did not provide it. The document is developed incrementally with executable
SQL and tests; the assignment's public input and output contracts remain unchanged.

## Shared analysis scope

Every section uses the same immutable scope:

- `topic.tag` must be present in `articles.tags`;
- `dateRange.from` is inclusive at `00:00:00`;
- `dateRange.to` is inclusive through the end of the day, implemented as an exclusive
  boundary at the next day's `00:00:00`;
- fixture timestamps and day boundaries use `Asia/Shanghai`;
- SQL values are bound parameters and never interpolated into query text.

The fixture data is deliberately synthetic and deterministic. It resembles a plausible
multi-platform event only so that calculations, edge cases, and visual output can be
reviewed without leaking production data.

## `metrics` — 全网数据概览

Purpose: give the reader a compact, auditable overview of the selected monitoring scope.

Inputs: no section-specific input.

Raw query outputs:

- total article count;
- positive, neutral, and negative article counts;
- distinct platform count;
- summed likes, comments, shares, and favorites;
- peak calendar day and its article count.

Derived in Python:

- each sentiment ratio;
- total engagement;
- display formatting for counts, dates, and percentages.

No-data rule: zero matching articles returns `no_data`; ratios are not rendered as
invented zero-percent findings.

Traceability: the fixed query lives at
`src/report_engine/data/queries/metrics.sql`; fixture integration tests compare its
result with the known seeded scope.

## Remaining project-defined sections

The authoritative IDs and user-facing purposes are defined in
`docs/final-framework.zh-CN.md`. Each section will be expanded here, before its code is
implemented, with inputs, fixed SQL, derived facts, evidence selection, charts,
narration contract, and no-data behavior.
